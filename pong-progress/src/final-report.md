# Final Report

## Generation Vs. Max-Fitness

The following presents a series of generation vs. max-fitness graphs, where the population size is varied. The data used to render each graph, as provided under each heading, is a series of max-fitness values of the generations. In other words, the line-separated values are the max-fitness values of each generation.

The first value is the max-fitness of the first generation, the second value is the max-fitness of the second generation, and so on. X-axis represents the generation numbers and the y-axis represents the fitness values.

Note that each of the graph covers a 30-generation session.

## Population Size vs. Max-Fitness After 30 Generations

The following graph shows population size vs. max-fitness right at the end of a 30-generation training session.

```

The 50-population training session has a max-fitness of 8.29 after 30 generations while the 300-population training session has a max-fitness of 9.33 after 30 generations.

Another way to look at it is that the graph shows the trend in population size vs. plateau height.

## Trend in Generations Required to Reach A Specific Max-Fitness

As the max-fitness at the end of the 50-population training session is 8.29, the following graph compares the population size with the number of generations taken to reach a max-fitness of 8.29.
