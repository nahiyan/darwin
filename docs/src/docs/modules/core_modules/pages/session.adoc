= Session

`Session` module holds data associated with a Darwin session, common to most, if not all, extensions.

All of its properties are static, meaning that these would be in the memory throughout the execution of a Darwin session. This is quite useful for storing session-specific data even before start of evolution.

Here are some of the data it holds:

* Extension ID
* Session ID
* Generation ID
* Generation Index
* Population Size
* Mutation Rate
* Elite Class Fraction
* Fertile Class Fraction
* Random Class Fraction
* cocos2d-x Session Speed
* HUD Selection (speed, mutation rate, etc)
