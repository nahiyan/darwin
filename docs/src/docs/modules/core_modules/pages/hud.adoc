= Heads-up Display

Heads-up Display, or the HUD, is a textual interface placed at a fixed position at one corner of the screen.

It's designed to meet the requirements of most extensions, typically used to display values such as:

* Generation Index
* Mutation Rate
* Speed

Some of the properties displayed in the HUD can be altered using the keyboard.

The module provides a way to update the text as required.
